# Document Sharding Architecture for Privacy-Preserving Document Management

## Executive Summary

This document outlines architectural approaches for implementing a privacy-preserving document management system where documents are sharded, encrypted, and distributed across decentralized storage. The goal is to ensure that possession of any single shard reveals no information about the document content, while maintaining user sovereignty over their data.

## Core Requirements

### Security Properties
- **Information Theoretic Security**: Individual shards must reveal zero information about document content
- **User-Controlled Encryption**: Only the document owner can decrypt and reconstruct the full document
- **Location Privacy**: Shard locations should be known only to the document owner
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of one document should not affect others

### Functional Requirements
- Support for variable document sizes (KBs to GBs)
- Efficient reconstruction from partial shards (erasure coding)
- Verifiable integrity without revealing content
- Compliance with data residency requirements
- Integration with existing identity and attestation systems

## Architectural Approaches

### Approach 1: ERC-1812 with Filecoin Storage

This approach leverages the ERC-1812 standard for verifiable claims combined with Filecoin's decentralized storage network.

**Architecture Overview:**
- Documents are split into N shards using deterministic chunking
- Each shard is individually encrypted using AES-256-GCM with unique derived keys
- Encrypted shards are stored on Filecoin with content addressing
- ERC-1812 claims store an array of shard Content Identifiers (CIDs)
- Shard metadata includes: total shard count, ordering information, and encryption parameters

**Advantages:**
- Leverages existing standards and infrastructure
- Filecoin provides cryptographic proofs of storage
- Content addressing ensures data integrity
- Claims can be easily transferred or delegated

**Limitations:**
- Gas costs scale linearly with shard count
- On-chain storage of all CIDs creates privacy concerns
- Limited flexibility in access control patterns
- No built-in support for threshold reconstruction

### Approach 2: Threshold Secret Sharing Systems

This approach uses cryptographic secret sharing schemes to provide information-theoretic security guarantees.

**Architecture Overview:**
- Documents undergo Shamir's Secret Sharing transformation (k-of-n threshold)
- Each share is encrypted with a unique key derived from master secret
- Shares are distributed across multiple storage providers
- Only the threshold number of shares needed for reconstruction
- Share locations stored in an encrypted manifest

**Key Innovations:**
- **Proactive Secret Sharing**: Periodically refresh shares without changing the secret
- **Verifiable Secret Sharing**: Cryptographic proofs that shares are valid
- **Hierarchical Sharing**: Different threshold levels for different document sections

**Advantages:**
- Information-theoretic security guarantees
- Resilience against storage provider failures
- Flexible access control through threshold selection
- No single point of failure

**Limitations:**
- Complex key management requirements
- Higher computational overhead for share generation
- Requires coordination for share refresh operations

### Approach 3: Hybrid Architecture (Recommended)

This approach combines the best elements of multiple strategies to create a robust, scalable solution.

**Architecture Components:**

1. **Document Processing Pipeline:**
   - Content-based chunking for deduplication
   - Reed-Solomon erasure coding for redundancy
   - Convergent encryption for each chunk
   - Metadata generation including Merkle tree of chunks

2. **Storage Layer:**
   - Primary storage on IPFS/Filecoin for availability
   - Backup shards on Arweave for permanence
   - Hot cache on traditional CDN for performance
   - Storage provider rotation for privacy

3. **Access Control Layer:**
   - Master document key encrypted to user's identity key
   - Proxy re-encryption for delegated access
   - Time-locked encryption for compliance holds
   - Quantum-resistant algorithms for long-term security

4. **On-Chain Registry:**
   - Minimal on-chain footprint (single root hash)
   - Off-chain manifest with shard locations
   - ZK proofs for ownership verification
   - Integration with ERC-725 identity contracts

## Implementation Considerations

### Key Management Architecture

The system must support multiple key hierarchies:
- **Identity Keys**: Long-term keys tied to user identity
- **Document Keys**: Unique per document, rotatable
- **Shard Keys**: Derived deterministically from document keys
- **Access Keys**: Temporary keys for delegated access

### Storage Provider Selection

Criteria for choosing storage providers:
- Geographic distribution for latency optimization
- Reputation scores from decentralized oracle networks
- Compliance certifications for regulatory requirements
- Economic incentives alignment through staking

### Privacy Enhancements

Additional privacy layers:
- **Onion Routing**: Route shard retrievals through privacy network
- **Decoy Traffic**: Generate fake retrievals to obscure access patterns
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Enable computation on encrypted shards
- **Private Information Retrieval**: Retrieve shards without revealing which ones

### Performance Optimization

Strategies for improving system performance:
- **Predictive Caching**: Pre-fetch likely needed shards
- **Progressive Reconstruction**: Start with low-resolution version
- **Parallel Retrieval**: Fetch shards from multiple providers simultaneously
- **Local Shard Cache**: Encrypted cache of frequently accessed shards

## Integration Points

### With Identity System (ERC-725/735)
- Document keys derived from identity claims
- Access control based on verified attributes
- Audit trails linked to identity attestations
- Recovery mechanisms through social recovery

### With Verification System
- Zero-knowledge proofs of document possession
- Selective disclosure of document sections
- Timestamping through blockchain anchoring
- Notarization without content revelation

### With Compliance Framework
- Encrypted audit logs with regulatory key escrow
- Geographic shard placement for data residency
- Right-to-erasure through key destruction
- Compliance attestations without document access

## Security Analysis

### Threat Model
- **External Attackers**: Cannot access encrypted shards
- **Storage Providers**: Cannot decrypt individual shards
- **Network Observers**: Cannot correlate shard accesses
- **Quantum Computers**: Post-quantum encryption for future-proofing

### Attack Scenarios and Mitigations
1. **Shard Correlation Attack**: Mitigated by random storage provider selection
2. **Timing Analysis**: Mitigated by constant-time operations and decoy traffic
3. **Key Compromise**: Limited impact due to key hierarchy and rotation
4. **Storage Provider Collusion**: Prevented by threshold schemes

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Cryptographic Techniques
- **Multi-Party Computation**: Process documents without decryption
- **Functional Encryption**: Grant computation-specific access
- **Witness Encryption**: Time-locked or event-based access
- **Indistinguishability Obfuscation**: Hide access patterns completely

### Scalability Improvements
- **Layer 2 Integration**: Move shard registry to rollups
- **State Channels**: Direct provider-user interactions
- **Distributed Hash Tables**: Decentralized shard discovery
- **Content Delivery Networks**: Hybrid centralized/decentralized caching

## Conclusion

The recommended hybrid architecture provides a robust foundation for privacy-preserving document management. By combining threshold secret sharing, convergent encryption, and decentralized storage, the system achieves strong security guarantees while maintaining practical performance. The modular design allows for future enhancements as cryptographic techniques and storage technologies evolve.

Key success factors include:
- Careful key management design
- Strategic storage provider selection
- Privacy-preserving access patterns
- Seamless integration with identity and compliance systems

This architecture positions the platform to meet both current regulatory requirements and future privacy expectations in the decentralized securities ecosystem.
