Users upload documents to the platform which are turned into NFTs minted to the user's wallet.
Only the user is able to see the documents.
With user consent, these documents can be used by Attribute Verifiers to verify credentials.
Audit trail stored in the NFT metadata
Verifier addresses and identifying information stored in VerifierRegistry
AttributeValidator checks that the attribute was issued by a registered verifier with the proper permissions

Users have identity contracts which can possess "attributes"
When an attribute is properly verified, an attribute will be added to the user's identity
Attribute checker can be used to check if the user has certain attributes

Verifier reputation system based on Fleek reputation system for servers
Verifiers able to mint NMA or USDC by verifiying attributes
